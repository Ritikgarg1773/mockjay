# MOCKJAY

Mockjay is a spin on the famous social networking website 'TWITTER', where instead of tweeting, you mock over a subject and are known as a mocker. The application was just developed as a challenge between my friends to build a webapp, where we can mock (as in upload a post), with a subject and provide a name alongside. All the posts would be saved on a local database and you can like and dislike the posts (as many no. of times you want, thats the problem). Currently there's no login or logout system but currently working on that. 

### Tech

MOCKJAY uses the following open source projects to work properly:

* [flask] - a microframework for python
* [w3.css] - a stylesheet from w3schools.com
* [atom] - a hackable text editor of 21st century from GITHUB
